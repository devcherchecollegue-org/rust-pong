# How to contribute to this project?
Hey beautiful people! We really appreciate you like our poject and in order to keep the
fun for everybody. This set of rules for now is only applied to branches and PRs naming.

## Commit messages convention
_Based on https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716_

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

### Example

```
feat: Add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense starting with a capital letter.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- `feature`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `ops`: (all ops changes and project structure/automation)

## PR convention
- Add a title in plain english/french
- A description which answers these 3 questions: _what?_, _why?_, (if need further explanation) _how?_
- Be polite
- Have fun!


# In case you failed to follow these rules
You will be damned to hell, and banned forever of this project!
No kidding - we are a bunch of human having fun, so depending on the mistake we might ask you to fix it!
Depending on the context, we prefer to push forward improvement than blocking someone for a typo to keep the fun
intact!




Thanks all for contributing ❤️
